# DA2324_PRJ1_G13_4 (Grade: 19.3)
DA 1ยบ Project
This project was made in the context of the Algorithm Design class.

This project supports the Management Team of a water supply network in Portugal to make informed
decisions about how to best allocate its resources, both financial as well as physical
(e.g., procurement of new pumping stations or installing new pipelines).

Such a tool will allow management to decide on aspects such as how to best assign selected
pumping stations to supply sources and how to identify more sensitive sections of its network
to failures to anticipate service disruption or at least to mitigate its nefarious effects.

This project was made by: Frederica Pereira (up202108167), Filipa Fidalgo (up202208039) and  Leonor Couto (up202205796).
